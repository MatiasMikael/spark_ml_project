# Spark ML Ops Project

## Description
This project analyzes search terms data from an e-commerce web server and uses a pre-trained sales forecasting model to predict sales for the year 2023. The original work was completed as part of the Data Engineer certification capstone project in JupyterLab.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PySpark
- JupyterLab

## Features
- Downloads and analyzes a dataset of search terms.
- Counts occurrences of specific search terms.
- Predicts sales using a linear regression model.

## Usage
1. Start a Spark session: Initialize the Spark environment in JupyterLab.
2. Download the dataset: Fetch the search terms data from the provided URL.
3. Load the data into a DataFrame: Read the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
4. Analyze the data: Run queries to explore search term usage.
5. Load the sales forecast model: Retrieve and extract the pretrained model.
6. Make predictions: Use the model to forecast sales for 2023.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have PySpark installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   pip install findspark

## Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of Spark for data analysis and machine learning, demonstrating how to leverage big data technologies in real-world applications.
